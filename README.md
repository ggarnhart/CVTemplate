# GGanhart.com CV Template

I developed this template in hopes of boosting my own online presence.
The HTML is mostly un-minified, but the css and js are not. I'd suggest leaving those alone, but do as you please.

Please use the Font Awesome Framework for the best results.

Feel free to use this as you please. It would be cool if you did not sell it.
